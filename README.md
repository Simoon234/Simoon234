Hello my name is Simon 👋👨‍💻 
I'm from Poland. 
Live in Warsaw. 
Language => JavaScript 🆒
Experience ~ 1.5 year. 
At the moment I'm a participant in a year-long course called MegaKurs. This cours is mainly focused on back-end but it includes front-end elements as well.
So far, I have learned such things as: 
a) Node 
b) Express
c) SQL & NoSQL
d) Typescript 
e) React & Redux
f) Next.js //It's actually great to build complex app!
g) NestJS


Of course, there are still many things I need to learn, develop, but I am aware of it and I want to develop further in this direction!
